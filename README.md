# AI for Security
## Politecnico di Milano
## 2019-2020

In this repository you can find all the notebooks used for the exercise sessions of the course "AI for Security" held at Politecnico di Milano during the Fall 2019 semester by Prof. Mark Carman.
The exercise sessions were held by L. Benedetto.

The idea for most of this exercises, as well as some pieces of code, comes from the [book](https://mlsec.net/) "Machine Learning and Security", written by C. Chio and D. Freeman and edited by O'Reilly.
